This is the task given to me by Ideamagix for my candidature at the company .
I have started making this first by using the flex to make the header and below that I have used bootstrap navbar for the navbar.
Below that has the home section which was created with inline-block to make it responsive.
The second navbar also has bootstrap navbar.
Below that the sections were created using flexbox and the form was made sticky to match it.
The images has lazy load on them so that the loader can be displayed.
I have used owl corousel for three of the scroller sections.
